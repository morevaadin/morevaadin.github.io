I'm not a front-end designer and that's the main reason why I love Vaadin. The framework lets you create professionally looking applications with no front-end skills. However, let's face it: to create your own theme is not really easy (as a reminder, please check [this previous post]({% post_url 2012-04-09-theming-and-custom-layout %}) and [this one]({% post_url 2012-09-23-vaadin-eases-your-theme-development %})), and the Vaadin team even recommends to use an existing theme and tweak it..

Contrary to other themes and thanks to the power of [Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](http://sass-lang.com/), Valo offers plenty of specific hooks in the form of functions and mixins to create new themes in a very easy way.

Those can be categorized into the following settings:

* General: general settings cover background color and line height
* Font: font settings govern... font, including size, weight, color and family
* Layout: layout settings configure the spacing and margin. It is finally possible to easily manage those parameters beside `layout.setMargin()` and `layout.setSpacing()`!
* Component: component settings are realted to focus, border, shadow, gradient, etc.
* Compilation and optimization: thos settings can tweak the compilation process

Valo is really well documented, but here's a small example of a custom `styles.scss` file for a so-called `custom` theme located under `${webroot}/VAADIN/themes/custom/styles.scss`:

{% highlight css %}
// General Settings
$v-app-loading-text: "Loading app, please wait...";
$v-background-color: #0ea5d7;
$v-app-background-color: lighten($v-background-color, 80%);

// Font Settings
$v-font-color: #464440;
$v-font-size: 14px;
$v-font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;

// Component Features
$v-border-radius: 0px;
$v-border: 2px solid v-tone;
$v-gradient: v-linear 20%;
$v-focus-style: 0 0 0 1px v-tint;

@import "../valo/valo";
{% endhighlight %}

Valo comes with a bunch of documentation and resources, including:

* The Book of Vaadin has a dedicated chapter dedicated to the [Valo theme](https://vaadin.com/book/vaadin7/-/page/themes.valo.html)
* The [SASS documentation](https://vaadin.com/api/valo/) generated by the `.scss` file
* Finally, this [Github sub-project](https://github.com/nfrankel/More-Vaadin/tree/master/valo-theme-example) uses the above snippet to display some components
